1. String is a primitive data type
2. Is a sequence of characters
3 .String is a class : 
    public final class String extends Object implements CharSequence, Serializable, Comparable{
        ...
    }
4. A string is an immutable Object.
5. 3 main classes of String: 
    i.      String
    ii.     StringBuffer
    iii.    String Builder

String Constant Pool: Special memory location in heap to store string literals.
    Memory present inside the heap memory, so it can change size as per need.

        String s1 = new String("smayan") : s1 points to object created in heap, but the string literal creates 
        another object in the SCP, JVM internally points to the obj in the SCP.

        String s2 = "rahul" : s2 points to object created in the SCP.

        String objects in the SCP cannot be deleted by garbage collection.
        If multiple strings have same literals then separate objects are created in the heap but they have a common obj in SCP.

    Strings are Immutable in Java as String objects are cached in String Pool, string literals are shared between multiple 
    strings, so one change can change the values for all other linked strings.

String is a final class, so it cannot be extended into child classes.

Multiple Strings can be concatenated using + operator.

Strings are immutable so they are thread safe and solve synchronization issues.
